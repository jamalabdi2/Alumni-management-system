# Alumni-management-system
This is a vanilla PHP project utilizing MySQL as its database. The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is designed for managing school alumni and events. I developed this project as part of an Advanced Web Development course.

# Content
This app comprises alumni registration functionality. After registering, alumni can log in to their accounts to view other alumni and edit their information. The user's information is stored in cookies to enable seamless access.

The second component involves events. The admin can register events, and these events are showcased on the homepage for all users to see.

In the third part, the admin can edit and delete alumni profiles as needed.

## Homepage

This serves as the application's entry point, where users can access information about ongoing events. Users also have the option to register or log in if they are already registered.

## User Registration

Users can input their information, and upon successful registration, they are redirected to the login page. In the event of an unsuccessful registration, they are redirected back.

## Login page

Only registered users can log in. If the user is registered and enters the correct login credentials, they are redirected to their respective page. User information is saved in the session to be used for authorization.

## Editing Alumni Information

Each alumnus has the power to edit his or her information. When the alumni click the edit link, they are redirected to the edit page with the form pre-populated with their information. They can then modify the information they want to change and submit the form. After successfully updating the information, they are redirected back to their respective page.
